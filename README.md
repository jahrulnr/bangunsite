## Components

### Web Management Interface
The main web interface for managing server configurations, containers, and files. Built with Laravel and AdminLTE.

### SSH Client
A web-based SSH client implementation using:
- Go backend for SSH connection handling
- Xterm.js for terminal emulation
- WebSocket for real-time communication

### Reverse Proxy
A Go-based reverse proxy service handling SSL termination and request forwarding.

### Mail Server
Includes MailCatcher for email testing and development.

## Development

For development, the following directories are mounted as volumes:
- `./web/app`
- `./web/database`
- `./web/public`
- `./web/resources`
- `./web/routes`

This allows for real-time code changes without rebuilding the container.

## Configuration

### SSL Certificates
Default self-signed certificates are automatically generated on first run. For production, replace with valid certificates in:
```
data/webconfig/ssl/live/default/
```

### Nginx Configuration
Custom Nginx configurations can be added to:
```
data/webconfig/site.d/
```

### PHP Configuration
PHP configurations can be modified in:
```
data/php/php.ini
```
